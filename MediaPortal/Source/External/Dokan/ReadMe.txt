In MP2, we use a slightly modified version of the Dokan Installer.
This directory contains the Dokan sources which are used to compile the Dokan
installer which is used from MP2.
The original Dokan code can be downloaded from Google Code ( http://code.google.com/p/dokan/ ).

The original files from svn (release, tags) have been checked out from Google Code ( http://code.google.com/p/dokan/ )
and only minor changes were made to the "dokan_install\install.nsi"-files of both the 0.53 and 0.6 versions.

To build the installer you need to install latest NSIS:
